The function should take the value of the `chartType` dropdown menu and use it to set the `chart.type` property for the generated chart.\n\n### Step 10:\n{ \n    \"actionType\": \"editFile\", \n    \"path\": \"static/js/sort.js\", \n    \"content\": \"chartData.chart.renderTo = 'chartContainer';\\nHighcharts.chart(chartData);\" \n}\n\nDescription: Modify the JavaScript function created in Step 1 to ensure that the generated chart is rendered to the correct HTML element. The `renderTo` property of the `chart` object should be set to `'chartContainer'`, the same id used for the container element added in Step 2. The `Highcharts.chart()` function should then be called with the `chartData` object to generate and display the chart in the HTML page. "

The function will convert the `number` input into decimal equivalent based on the `base` input (2 for binary, 8 for octal, 16 for hexadecimal), and return the decimal value.\n\n### Step 3:\n{\n    \"actionType\": \"editFile\",\n    \"path\": \"static/js/main.js\",\n    \"content\": \"// function to convert decimal sum to desired base\\nfunction convertToBase(number, base) {\\n  return number.toString(base);\\n}\"\n}\n\nAdd a new function `convertToBase()` to `main.js` that takes two arguments: `number` and `base`.

It will then convert each input number to decimal via the `convertToDecimal()` function, using the retrieved base as the second argument. After calculating the sum, it will use the `convertToBase()` function to convert the output sum to the selected base. Finally, update the `groups` variable by calling the `groupNumbers()` function with the converted input numbers and the selected base, and call `renderElements()` with the new variables.\n\n### Step 5:\n{\n    \"actionType\": \"editFile\",\n    \"path\": \"templates/index.html\",\n    \"content\": \"<select id='baseSelect'>\\n  <option value='2'>Binary</option>\\n  <option value='8'>Octal</option>\\n  <option value='16'>Hexadecimal</option>\\n</select>\"\n}\n\nAdd the newly created dropdown menu HTML element to the HTML page `index.html`.
