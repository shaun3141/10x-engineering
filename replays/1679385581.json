If 'multiply' is chosen, use a product function to multiply the numbers instead of summing them.\n\nPlease remember the following application constraints:\nThis 'app' should remain in one file\n\n## Source Directory\nThe files in this application are organized in a specific way.

It must be one of the following values:\n\n- runTerminal: Execute a command in a terminal or command prompt window.\n- createFile: Create a new file with the specified contents.\n- editFile: Modify an existing file by replacing all of its content with something new.\n- renameFile: Rename an existing file.\n- deleteFile: Delete an existing file.\n\n### path: string\nA required field specifying the location of the file to create, edit, rename, or delete. The path should include the file's name and extension. For example: `src/components/Header.js`. This field is not needed for the `runTerminal` actionType.\n\n### content: string\nA required field containing the primary information related to the action. Depending on the actionType, this could be:\n\n- Code to execute in a terminal window for `runTerminal`.\n- Contents of a file to create for `createFile`, always written in full.\n- New code to replace all of the current code in an existing file for `editFile`, always written in full.\n- The new name of the file to be renamed for `renameFile`\nThe `content` field can be blank for the `deleteFile` action type.\n\n### Step 1: \n{ \n    \"actionType\": \"\""
