    " {\"fileMapping\": [\n    \"coolness.py\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThe implementation of the feature request will be done in the `coolness.py` file.\n\nTo start with, we need to define the scoring system. Here are the criteria we will use to assign coolness factor to each number:\n- Prime Numbers: 5 points\n- Divisible by 3: 3 points\n- Contains digit 9: 2 points\n- Other Numbers: 1 point\n\nBased on these criteria, we can define a function to calculate the score for each number as follows:\n\n```\ndef calculate_coolness_factor(num):\n    if num == 2 or num == 3:   # Check for prime number\n        return 5\n    elif num % 3 == 0:    # Check for divisible by 3\n        return 3\n    elif '9' in str(num):   # Check for digit 9\n        return 2\n    else:\n        return 1\n```\n\nNow that we have the scoring system in place, we can loop through the list of numbers, calculate the score for each number, and return the sum of scores instead of the sum of numbers. Here's how the final code will look like:\n\n```\nimport json\n\ndef calculate_coolness_factor(num):\n    if num == 2 or num == 3:  \n        return 5\n    elif num % 3 == 0:    \n        return 3\n    elif '9' in str(num):  \n        return 2\n    else:\n        return 1\n\ndef calculate_score(numbers):\n    score = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        score += calculate_coolness_factor(num)\n    return score\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    numbers = [2, 9, 11, 15, 19, 20, 25, 30, 33, 40]\n    result = calculate_score(numbers)\n    print(json.dumps({\"score\": result}))\n```\n\nWhen we run the code, it will output a JSON blob with the key \"score\" and the value will be the sum of the scores of the list of numbers. \n\nNote: We have assumed that \"Other Numbers\" have a coolness factor of 1. You can modify the scoring system as per your needs.\n\nThat's it! The feature request is now implemented. ",

Here are the criteria we will use to assign coolness factor to each number:\n- Prime Numbers: 5 points\n- Divisible by 3: 3 points\n- Contains digit 9: 2 points\n- Other Numbers: 1 point\n\nBased on these criteria, we can define a function to calculate the score for each number as follows:\n\n```\ndef calculate_coolness_factor(num):\n    if num == 2 or num == 3:   # Check for prime number\n        return 5\n    elif num % 3 == 0:    # Check for divisible by 3\n        return 3\n    elif '9' in str(num):   # Check for digit 9\n        return 2\n    else:\n        return 1\n```\n\nNow that we have the scoring system in place, we can loop through the list of numbers, calculate the score for each number, and return the sum of scores instead of the sum of numbers. Here's how the final code will look like:\n\n```\nimport json\n\ndef calculate_coolness_factor(num):\n    if num == 2 or num == 3:  \n        return 5\n    elif num % 3 == 0:    \n        return 3\n    elif '9' in str(num):  \n        return 2\n    else:\n        return 1\n\ndef calculate_score(numbers):\n    score = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        score += calculate_coolness_factor(num)\n    return score\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    numbers = [2, 9, 11, 15, 19, 20, 25, 30, 33, 40]\n    result = calculate_score(numbers)\n    print(json.dumps({\"score\": result}))\n```\n\nWhen we run the code, it will output a JSON blob with the key \"score\" and the value will be the sum of the scores of the list of numbers. \n\nNote: We have assumed that \"Other Numbers\" have a coolness factor of 1. You can modify the scoring system as per your needs.\n\nThat's it! The feature request is now implemented. "
